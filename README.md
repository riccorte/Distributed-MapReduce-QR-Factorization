# Distributed algorithms

The goal of this project was to implement a **QR decomposition algorithm** for tall-and-skinny matrices that leverages Daskâ€™s parallel computing capabilities on a cluster of machines (CloudVeneto). Following [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1071), me and my colleagues implemented three versions of the QR decomposition algorithm:
1) QR decomposition via Cholesky decomposition
2) QR indirect method
3) QR direct method

An extensive benchmark section is provided, where we analyzed how the algorithms respond to variations in some cluster hyperparameters, such as the number of partitions and the number of workers, and even the complexity of the task (i.e., the size of the matrix).
